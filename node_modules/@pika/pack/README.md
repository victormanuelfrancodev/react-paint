## @pika/pack helps you build amazing packages without the hassle:

- **Simple** &nbsp;‚ö°Ô∏è&nbsp; Use pre-configured plugins to build your package for you.
- **Flexible** &nbsp;üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è&nbsp; Choose plugins and optimizations to match your needs.
- **Holistic** &nbsp;‚öõÔ∏è&nbsp; Let us build the entire package... *including package.json.*


## Quickstart

Getting started is easy:

```js
// 1. Install it!
$ npm install -g @pika/pack
// 2. Add this to your package.json manifest:
"@pika/pack": {
  "pipeline": []
}
// 3. Run it!
$ pack build
```

### üòé üÜí

So now what? If you run `pack build` with an empty pipeline, you'll get an empty package build. **@pika/pack** lets you connect pre-configured plugins to build and optimize your package for you. Plugins wrap already-popular tools like Babel and Rollup with npm-optimized config options, removing the need to fiddle with much (if any) configuration yourself. You even get a generated package.json manifest configured for you ***automatically***.

### 1. Create a project pipeline out of simple, pluggable builders.

```js
// Before: Your top-level package.json manifest:
{
  "name": "simple-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "@pika/pack": {
    "pipeline": [
      ["@pika/plugin-standard-pkg", {"exclude": ["__tests__/**/*"]}],
      ["@pika/plugin-build-node"],
      ["@pika/plugin-build-web"],
      ["@pika/plugin-build-types"]
    ]
  }
}
```

Builders are simple, single-purpose build plugins defined in your `package.json`. For example, `@pika/plugin-build-node` & `@pika/plugin-build-web` build your package for those different environments. Other, more interesting builders can bundle your web build for [unpkg](https://unpkg.com), generate TypeScript definitions from your JavaScript, addon a standard CLI wrapper for Node.js builds, and even compile non-JS languages to WASM (with JS bindings added).

### 2. Builders handle everything, including package configuration.

```js
// After: your built "pkg/" package.json manifest:
{
  "name": "simple-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  // Multiple distributions, built & configured automatically:
  "esnext": "dist-src/index.js",
  "main": "dist-node/index.js",
  "module": "dist-web/index.js",
  "types": "dist-types/index.d.ts",
  // With sensible package defaults:
  "sideEffects": false,
  "files": ["dist-*/", "assets/", "bin/"]
}
```

This is all possible because **@pika/pack** builds your entire package: code, assets, and even package.json manifest. By building the entire package, you end up with a fully-built `pkg/` directory, ready to publish. Entry points like "main", "module", "umd:main", "types", "unpkg", "files", and even advanced options like "sideEffects" are all handled by your build pipeline.

## Lerna Support

Curious about integrating @pika/pack with Lerna? Our official collection of plugins is a Lerna repo that uses @pika/pack to build each package! [Check it out](https://github.com/pikapkg/builders) to see how easy it is to use the two tools together.


## Bonus Command: `publish`

</p>

We've brought our favorite parts of [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) (a self-described "better npm publish") into **@pika/pack**. With the `publish` command there's no need to worry about how to publish your package once you've built it.

Run `pack publish` in your project and **@pika/pack** will walk you through version bumping, tagging your release, generating a fresh build, and finally publishing your package.
